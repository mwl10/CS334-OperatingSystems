# CS334-OperatingSystems Course Labs and Assignments

Threading Lab: 

In this lab you will get practice with locks, condition variables, and the pthread library by writing two multi-threaded programs.

  For problem 1 we model a subway station using threads, by writing synchronization functions that guarantee an orderly     loading of trains. Each passenger and each train is controlled by a thread.
  
   For problem 2 we have been hired by Mother Nature to help her out with the chemical reaction to form water, which she doesnâ€™t seem to be able to get right due to synchronization problems. The trick is to get two H atoms and one O atom together at the same time. Each atom is represented by a thread.
